## Churn Prediction

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition, is the percentage of subscribers to a service who discontinue their subscriptions to that service within a given time period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed its churn rate.

Attribute Name | Description
------------- | ---------------------------------------------------
State | categorical, for the 50 states and the District of Columbia
VoiceMail Plan | dichotomous categorical, yes or no
Account length | integer-valued, how long account has been active
Number of voice mail messages | integer-valued
Area code | categorical
Total day minutes | continuous, minutes customer used service during the day
Phone number | essentially a surrogate for customer ID
Total day calls | integer-valued
International Plan | dichotomous categorical, yes or no
Total day charge | continuous, perhaps based on foregoing two variables
Total evening minutes | continuous, minutes customer used service during the evening.
Total night charge | continuous, perhaps based on foregoing two variables
Total evening calls | integer-valued
Total international minutes | continuous, minutes customer used service to make international calls.
Total evening charge | continuous, perhaps based on foregoing two variables
Total international calls | integer-valued
Total night minutes | continuous, minutes customer used service during the night
Total international charge | continuous, perhaps based on foregoing two variables
Total night calls | integer-valued
Number of calls to customer service | integer-valued
Churn | Label indicating if customer churned
